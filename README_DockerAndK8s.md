# Applying this project in Docker and Kubernetes(K8s)

## we assume that you have 2 things before strating this tutuorial:
   - You installed docker in your system.
   - You installed minikube in your system.
   - In my case, I clone this project which contains(HTML, CSS, JS, and images) .
  
 ## Docker steps 
  
  ### 1. Create dockerFile 
   ![dockerFile](/docker-k8s-images/dockerfile-image.png)
   
   
 As you see, the dockerFile contains only 2 lines. The first line reffered the base image of any web page whcih is nginx( it is a server that can run web containers. the second line we copy all resourcses(including codes and images) to the container.
  
  ### 2. Build your docker image from the dockerFile
  
  open you terminal/ cmd then type this command: docker build -t imagename:version (make sure of the path).
    
 ![imagecreation](/docker-k8s-images/docker-image-creation.png)
     
  Now your image is created so let push it to docker hub.
